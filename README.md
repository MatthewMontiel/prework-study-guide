# Prework-Study-Guide Wedpage
A study guide for course pre-work

## Description

The main purpose of this project was to get a grasp of some of the basic fundamentals of coding. I did this by using a newly introduced mindset called Agile. This mindset allowed for me to understand the proper workflow needed to complete a coding project. I built this project using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I was also introduced to Github and have used a SSH to allow for me to send any updated code to my GitHub repository where I can then pull requests and merge my local code with my code stored in the cloud. This project serves as a reference guide to notes for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.

## Usage

Each section on my Prework Study Guide site contains helpful notes about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. Using Chrome DevTools you can also open up the console on the browser to see my Javascript running. This simple code allows for the console to randomly select a random section to study everytime you refresh the page.
